# nvim_config
My neovim config stuff so I don't have to make a new config every time I use a new machine. very strongly motivated by theprimeagen on youtube.

### requirements (reminder)
- will need npm for lsp servers(sudo apt install npm)
- actually install neovim lol
- might want to get new colors, these are ok at best. (i like the light theme with 0 transparency for editing code)
